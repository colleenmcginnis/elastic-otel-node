The Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Node.js (the "Distro") is a Node.js
package that provides:

* an easy way to instrument your application with OpenTelemetry, and
* configuration defaults for best usage.

Use the Distro to start the OpenTelemetry SDK with your Node.js application to automatically
capture tracing data, performance metrics, and logs. Traces, metrics, and logs are sent
to any OTLP collector you choose. Use an https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic Observability]
deployment -- hosted in Elastic's cloud or on-premises -- to monitor your applications, create alerts,
and quickly identify root causes of service issues.
